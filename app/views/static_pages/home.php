				<p>
				Inspired by my recent work with Ruby on Rails I have set out to develop a simple MVC framework for PHP, in an attempt to better understand MVC design principles.
				As part of this process I am developing a personal budgeting app, which will be built using this framework.
				However, code for that app will not be availible until the project is further along.  Code for the framework, which is still in early development, is availible on github though.
