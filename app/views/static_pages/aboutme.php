			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>
			My name is Patrick Stephens and I help to build the web. I am a web developer specializing in HTML, XHTML, CSS, PHP, and javascript coding, with an emphasis on responsive web design and dynamic web pages. Most comfortable working in a LAMP environment, I enjoy designing and developing web applications that allow users to work and connect in new ways. My experience includes I have developing and maintaining websites for my own business ventures, and to this day I enjoy continuing to help others bring their sites to life.
