Welcome to Serenity | "Serene PHP made easy"
===========================================

The goal of Serenity is to give php developers a easy to learn framework that will make web application development fast and easy.

Full documentation will eventually be avilible at [www.serenephp.com](http://www.serenephp.com),  however, currently this framework is being used for my own personal use while I work out the bugs.

Models
------

The following functions are availible to all of your models through the baseModel class.

*******************************************
save()

Saves the information stored in the objects public attributes to the coresponding columns in the database. This function can be passed a single argument in the form of an array, containing information to be assigned to the objects attributes before the information is stored in the database.
